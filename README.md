A project for The Odin Project, this app will work as a CV template, where you enter info about your background and get a nice looking CV out of it.

It was my first time using React, this project helped me to grasp the basics like hooks, state and jsx syntax.

Here's the link to the app - https://cv-builder-odin.netlify.app/
